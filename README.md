# Build Your Own World
The final project of UC Berkeley's course CS61B entailed the generation of a randomized world, along with an interface that enabled user interactivity. The world's environment and time of day are randomized, with the onscreen display indicating as much, and the user can explore the world similarly to how they would in a video game.
All code in the Core folder was written by me. The libraries we were given to run the program were provided by Java and Princeton University.
